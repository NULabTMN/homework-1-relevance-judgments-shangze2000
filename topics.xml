	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment
The Constitution of the Unit
ed StAtfls was mimnsplv maAo Aif
icultj to amend. Madison, the
'Father of the Constitution,' was
against ''innovation' and Hamil-'
ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
ging people. So the Constitution'
was made unchangeable except b.
a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
and three-fourths of the State
, Legislatures or State Conventions.
One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
day, if prperly placoed, can block'
any amendment. Of the four,
hundred and thirty-five amend-'
wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
belief of many people that the;
Constitution can never be amend-'
ed. I
"We, on 'the other hand, believe ,
Amendment permiting the income1
tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
mously adopted by the Senate,
and. almost unanimously by the
House. Thirty-five of the forty
six States must ratify, but thirty-five
States will be found. The
South is for it; the west is for
it; the real people of the East
are for it; the two parties have
declared in. its favor and Presi
dent Taft has taken his stand on
it. It is more than the mere
question of an income tax, al
though that is important. It is a
question of national sovereignty,
of the right of ninety millions of
petTple to tax. themselves as they
deem just and expedient. It is
an issue upon which in times of
danger the national welfare, ev
en the national existence, might
depend. The Sixteenth Amend
ment nnist and will be adopted.
But it will not be adopted by
the people staying at. home and
wishing for it. It must be made
an issue in every 'State, in every
assembly district. Time fights
on the side of the Sixteenth
Amendment; there is no limit.
Once a State adopts it, the rati
fication lasts' forever. But if
the ratification is not made the
first session, H may be again pro-,
posed for 'the second, " third,
tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwe
do not suceed at first,, we can
j try, try again.
I The Sixteenth Amendment
' must be ratfiied, not only to en
able pur Government in times of
peace and war to impose equita-.
ble taxes, but also to place the
fundamental law of the land,
where it should be placed in the
hands of an intelligent, tolerant,
and liberty-loving, people.

	<text>THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT IN THE LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE.(To the Caucasian)
As shown by the House Journal of
1910 the Sixteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States was
endorsed by the popular branch of the
General Assembly as follows
Mr. Johnson of Washington intro
duced House Concurrent Resolution
No. t, ratifying the Sixteenth Amend
mient to the Constitution of the United
States, which was referred to the corn
nittee on Federal relations. After due
consideration this comlnittee reported
as follows:
"House of Representatives, State of
Loutiiana, Baton Rouge, La., May 20,
19to.-To the Honorable the Speaker
and Members of the House of Repre
sentatives of the State of Louisiana
Gentlemen : I ant directed by your com
mittee on Federal relations to submit
the following report : House Concurrent
Resolution No. i, by Mr. Johnson (of
Washington) ratifying the Sixteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States (here printing the reso
lution). Favorably.
"W. E. RICHARI)SON,
"Chairman.'
Two members of the committee dis
sented and submitted a minority sub
stitute.
On June 2 this substitute was indefin
itely postponed on motion of Mr. John
son of Washington by a rising vote of
68 yeas and 31 nays. The question then
recurred on the motion to adopt 'the
resolution to ratify the amendment. The
roll being called resulted as follows:
Yeas 78; nays 3t; absent 7.
Thus it is seen that the House voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the Income
Tax Amendment.
But in the Senate-As shown by the
Senate Journal the Sixteenth or Income
Tax Amendment was overwhelmingly
defeated.
On June 7 the House Concurrent Res
olution by Mr. Johnson was so amended
as to refer the said Sixteenth Amend
ment to a general State primary elec
tion for ratification or rejection by the
qualified electors, said vote to be binding
on the next General Assembly. The vote
on this amendment was yeas 26, nays
ii, absent 4.
As amended the Johnson resolution
was concurred in by the Senate by the
following vote: Yeas 28, nays 9, ab
sent 4.
The Johnson Concurrent Resolution
having thus been materially amended by
the Senate was sent back to the House
for concurrence in the Senate amend
ment. The House refused to concur,
and the amended resolution was sent to
conference, both houses appointing con
ferrees. There the Johnson resolution
rests, and the Sixteenth Amendment
failed of ratification in so-called Demo
cratic Louisiana. On the South rests
the responsibility. But the Democrats
will elect a new General Assembly in
1912. A LEGAL OBSERVER.

There was nothing tn it yesterday
but unless somebody spikes the guns
before 1 -o'clock today the hair-raising
stunts will begin and before sundown
every judge in the state of Arizona
and every man who has a few dollars
:md sixty cents will have license to
tremble in his shoes, if he is at ail
nervous in his temperament. Rules
have been adopted sufficient for the
legal transaction of legislative busi
ness and as soon as the decks are
cleared for action this morning a
concurrent resolution will be intro
duced in both houses., submitting to
the people an amendment to the con
stitution providing for the recall of
judges, and it will be passed quicker
than either President Taft or the
proletariat can say Jack Robinson.
.Colore the smoke clears away a joint
resolution will drift in. to the effect
that Arizona endorses the proposed
sixteenth amendment to the constitu
tion of the United States, providing
for an income tax. Thirty-one states
have already endorsed it and only five
more are needed. There will be one
less today and the time has arrived
for the plutocrats to throw up their
hands, or at least stand up and be
counted.
Anyhow, that was the frame-up last
night.
TlHJt the legislature would do this
very thing very early in the session
has been expected, but it was left for
the genius of Homer 'Wood, council
man from Yavapai to inject the spec
tucular coloring into the project. That
is the. reason no more was done yes
terday. It had been planned to do
nothing else until these matters had
been worked out of the legislative
system. The houses were organized
ami everything put in readiness, but
with a clean slate until the soda pop,
root beer or whatever the medicine
was. should get the gentlemen in con
dition for the effort, and now they
are ready.
It would seem to the ordinary per
son that this state of preparedness
ought not to be hard to attain but
the ordinary person has little knowl
edge of just how thoroughly the work
was to be done. The democratic
brethren went before the people
pledged to put back the recall pro
vision eliminated last December, pre
cisely in the same form it appeared
in the original constitution and they
propose to redeem that pledge or bust
their galluses. Homer Wood took the
trouble to secure from the archives
the identical official copy or the orig
inal constitution, and swearing in
blood that he would return the sacred
document to its proper custodian he
sought the lair of a photographer,
where he had the recall section re
produced with every pen-scratch,
smear and fly speck, together with
the yellow spots made by the tears in
which it was bathed when It was
found the section was for the time
being to be ineffective.
One of these photographic repro
ductions will form the body of the
resolution that Is to be introduced in
each house this morning as soon as
the prayers of the chaplains cease
their echoing iind Mr. Wood can gain
recognition of President Cunniff and
Judge Wren or Yavapai can detect
the nod or Speaker Bradner.
After this deed has been done C. B.
Wood will seize the earliest oppor- j
tunity in the senate and Don Babbitt;
in the house, to present Arizona's j
formal ratification of the sixteenth
amendment to the constitution of the!
United States. These gentlemen did
not have time to senu for the original
copy in Washington to incorporate a
picture in their resolution, but will
have to express their sentiments in
the artistic hand of an official typist.</text>

	<text>Sixteenth Amendment.
Washington. Feb. 3.â€”The provi
sion authorizing an income tax as now
i?nnen.?nPÂ£rtknown
.of
the federal
constituÂ­
tion will be as the "Sixteenth
Amendment" and reads as follows:
Article XVI.â€”The congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes on
incomes, from whatever source de-
w'",ou'
apportionment among
the states, and without regard to any
census or enumeration."
The change in the fundamental la'V
or the land marks a new epoch in the
American tax system. For the first,
time congress is given specific authori
ty by a provision of the federal con
stitution to levy an income tax. All
previous efforts for a tax of this kind
have been without the explicit author
ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
change also marks a broad develop
ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
lar to the systems now in force in
Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
Spain and various other countries.
New Source of Revenue.
Probably the most important aspect
of an income tax. as now authorized
by the constitution, is that it adds a
new source of revenue for the govern
ment. At present the two great
sources of government revenue aro
customs duties levied by tariff acts on
goods imported from foreign coun
tries and internal revenue taxes on
tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
tain other articles. Each of these
sources at present produces a little
less than half of the total revenues
of the government. In 1911 the total
government revenues were $700,100,
906 and of this customs duties yielded
$11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
mainder came from sales of public
lands, the corporation tax and various
miscellaneous sources. Under an in
come tax, however, a new and far
reaching source of revenue ls provid
ed for the government, and this will
in turn reduce the amounts required
rfom the other sources of revenue,'
customs and internal revenue, in or
der to meet the expenses of govern
ment. This last phase is likely to have
an important bearing on tariff legis
lation as hereafter enacted.
Before the amendment formally be
comes a part of the constitution to.
day's action of the legislature must be
transmitted to the secretary of state
at Washington and proclamation of
the ratification made.
First Step In 1909.
The first official step toward amend
ing the constitution so as to authorise
specifically an income tax was taken
by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
unanimous vote, that body adopted a
resolution, submitting this amend
ment to the legislatures of the respec
tive states. Only a few days later, on
July 12, the house passed the resolu
tion by a vote of 317 to 14.

	<text>Democrats Will Pass A Speedy Law To Enforce Measure.
Here is the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, rati
fied Monday:
"Article XVI. The Congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes
on incomes, from whatever source
derived, with ou t apportionment
among the several States, and with
out regard to any census or enumer
a'ion." Wyoming had the honor of mak
ing the amendment effective. With
in two hours after word was received
that the Wyoming Legislature had
ratified the amendment, a telegram
was received by Senator RichardHon,
of Delaware, Btating that his State
had also ratified the amendment,
and to this was added New Mexico,
making thirty-eight States to act
favorably, Utah and New Jersey
are expected to do the same. Only
thirty-six were needed.
The Democrats tariff makers of
the House and Senate forthwith an
nounced that thby would begin pre
parations at once to enact an income
tax law a3 a part of the Democratic
tariff programme at the coming ex
tra (Session of Congress. Senator
Simmons, of North Carolina, who
will probably be the next chairman
of the Finance Committee, spoke
for the Senate. Representative Hull,
of Tennessee, the income tax expert
of the Ways and Means Committee.
spoke for the House.
Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
ka, Republican, author of the
amendment, which he introduced in
the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
pardonable pride, announced to the
Senate during the afternoon that
three-fourths of the sovereign States
had ratified it. He congratulated
the Senate and the country on the
result. The amendment will not be
come actually a part of the Constitu
tion until the notice of the ratifi
cation by Wyoming or Delaware has
been formally filed with the Senator
of StatP, which will doubtless be
within a few days.
The Democrats propose to raise
approximately $100,000,000 a year
by the new tax and to graduate it
so that persons of great wealth will
pay at a higher rate.</text>

	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
out regard to any census or enumeration."
Congress having been given this power what is its duty ? We
believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress ; that the
amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
arise.
As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good ? We
think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
of the people.
The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
ing it up ; that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
the rich, where we believe it belongs.
But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
one.
It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
from others : that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay

	<text>INCOME TAX LAW AGAIN ATTACKED.
Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
for Union Pacific Railroad stock
holders and others have filed a brief
in the Supreme Court attacking as
unconstitutional the income tax
provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
tariff law.
The attorneys contend that while
the sixteenth amendment empowers
congress to impose a tax on "incomes
from whatever source derived," the
framers of the law stretched it to
cover many taxes other than on in
come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
constitutional authority for taxing a
specific class of persons, unmarried
men, more than others, or for the
super-tax imposed upon men with
incomes over $20,000.</text>

	<text>TESTING INCOME TAX
Constitutionality of Law Is Put Up to
the Supreme Court of the
United States.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 13.â€”An an
nual revenue to the government of
$82,000,000 depends on the outcome of
arguments today before the supreme
court on the constitutionality of the
income tax. The first cases to reach
the court under the new system of fed
eral taxation and the first Involving
the construction of the sixteenth
amendment were at issue.
Attacking the law were corporations
objecting to the law in part and as an
entirety mining companies voicing
objections to the tax on mining In
come and individuals, attacking prin
cipally the additional tax on incomes
in excess of $20,000. The main de
fense of the law has been prepared by

	<text>Supreme Tribunal Sustains New York Jurist in Decision on Macomber Test Case.
Stock dividends are not taxable un
der the 1916 income tax law, the
United States Supreme Court decided
today.
A test caso was brought by Mrs.
Myrtle H. Macomber in the New York
Federal courts to recover taxes paid
on 1,100 shares of stock of Standard
Oil of California given as a stock
dividend The loA'er courts decided
in her favor and the Government,
through Mark Kisner, then collector
of Internal revenue for New York, ap
pealed the rase to the Supreme

The decision upholding that of the

	<text>How About Aid for Us TAXPAYERS?
From time to time throughout
the history of this nation, amend
ments have been made to our Con
stitution. Those Founding Fathers
who were wise enough to draft the
greatest document of political free
dom in all world history, knew
that with the growth of the U.S.A.,
and changing conditions, modifica
tions would have to be made.
Therefore, they most wisely made
provision for amendments to the
Constitution and prescribed the
methods for enacting them.
Including the Bill of Rights (the
first ten made shortly after the
drafting of the Constitution) in all,
twenty-two amendments have been
made to the Constitution. It is a
distinct compliment to the fore
sight of the Founding Fathers that
a number of these amendments
have been injurious to, rather than
constituting improvements to that
historic document.
One of these —the 16th Amend
ment—was a grave error. First,
because it granted the Federal
Government the right to levy and
collect taxes on incomes. Second,
and this is what really has caused
grievous trouble, no limitation was
put as to the percentage the gov
ernment can levy and collect.
During the debate in the Senate,
on the enabling act for submission
to the States for ratification, one
very astute Senator suggested that
a limitation of ten per cent be
written into the act as to the per
centage Federal Government could
levy on incomes. He was almost
laughed out of the Seriate for
deigning to suggest that any Con
gress of the U.S.A, would ever
dare to take as high as ten per
cent of a company’s or an indi
vidual’s income. No limitation was
put into the 16th Amendment, and
we now witness the sad spectacle
of the Federal Government not
only deigning, but actually taking
as high as 91 percent of certain
incomes.
Chief Justice Marshall, in con
curring with Daniel Webster, said:
“The power to tax is the power to
destroy.” The several States which
ratified the 16th Amendment most
certainly would not have done so
had they dreamed that some day
the Federal Government would
presume to take as high as 91 per
cent of an individual’s income.
Communism’s basic demand is
confiscation of all wealth. It is

that we have gotten dangerously
near to confiscation and commun
ism by permitting the Federal

Government to levy such a heavy
impost on incomes.
The Founding Fathers intended
to leave to the individual States
and to local governments within
the States, a maximum of author
ity to conduct their own State and
local affairs. At present the Fed
eral Government under the au
thority vested in it by the 16th
Amendment, has the power and is
exercising it, to tax incomes—
both large and small—to the point
where there is little or no taxing
power left for the States.
This increased Federal taxation.

The Federal Government has
usurped many of the functions
that rightfully and constitutionally
belong to State and local govern

To fully protect the rights of
the people, the States and the lo
cal communities, the 16th Amend
ment should be repealed. Failing
that, then, at least, a definite
limitation should be placed upon
the Federal Government’s power
to levy taxes on incomes. True de
mocracy in a Republic such as
ours, is based on a form of self
government by the people and
their elected representatives in
their own localities, whether by
States, counties, townships or
towns. No centralized government
at a remote capital, such as Wash
ington, can efficiently and wisely
decide what is best for all the
people in a country as large as the
U.S.A.
The.States Rights Party which
had T. Coleman Andrews as its
candidate for president in the
1956 election, is for outright re
peal of the 16th Amendment —to
abolish the Federal income tax
entirely. This Party, organized
just a few weeks prior to the elec
tion, made quite a remarkable
showing. It rolled up enough votes
to encourage its leaders to look
toward 1960 with confidence. It
is now flexing its muscles. With
four years of organization, it prom
ises to be a real factor, come 1960.

	<text>THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT
THE income tax amendment to the Constitution of the United
States having been ratified by the Legislatures of three
fourths of the States, is now a part and parcel of that his
toric document. It is the sixteenth amendment to the Constitu
tion. and the first added since 1870. Another will probably be
adopted within the next two years, this being an amendment
providing for the election of United States Senators directly by
the vote of the people. Both are distinctly progressive meas
ures. and are the result of long and patient work for popular
government.
The income tax amendment has occupied the attention of the
people of the United States for the past twenty-five years. A
law providing for the levying of an income tax was passed dur
ing Cleveland's second term, only to be declared unconstitutional
by the United States Supreme Court, by a bare majority of that
body. Indeed, it was charged at the time, and it has been re
peated many times since, that Judge Shiras changed his opin
ion overnight, when it was found that with it the constitutional
ity of the law would be upheld.
It is estimated that the operation of the law will produce
a revenue of one hundred millions dollars?a tidy sum that will
come from those who have and are much better able to spare
than the people upon whom the heaviest burdens of taxation now
fall. In other words, the rich will be compelled to contribute di
rectly to the national treasury, while the tariff tax will be lifted
to some extent from the shoulders of the great mass of people.
The prolonged fight against the adoption of an income tax
has been waged by entrenched wealth, and it is only within the
last few years that public opinion became sufficiently aroused
to force the passage of the proposed amendment by the Congress,
and compel its ratification by the requisite number of States.

	<text>Sixteenth Amendment.
BT H. S. YOUNG.
Are human beings possessed now a days
with so morbid so appetite that it csn be
only appeased by a continued course of
intense excitement, even of the most
revolting and unworthy nature.
The lives and sets of those who consti
tute the "power of the nation," certainly
prove the world of mind strangely agog.
Ever since tho cessation^ - of hostilities
there have been wranglings, quibblings
and juggliugs without end to annex a
Fifteenth Amendment; end scarcely his
this fiendish deed been accomplished than
the politicul heavens become overcast by
a cloud of more terrible import than all
others, in the form of a Sixteenth Amend
ment.
And what does it mean ? What need
for another appendage 7 What its sub
ject? What its object? Women of
America, veil your pure taces to conceal
the blushes that should mantle your
checks at mention of the word Sixteenth
Amendment, for it is sn insult to your
purity?s shame to your honor, the
death-blow to your womanhood.
You may question how this can be ?
How t Is it no shame that men should
stand in legislative hall and use the pure
and gentle nsme of woman in noisy de
bate or, hnrsh and jeering tone, that
should make the heurt die .' uTis sod
that men should scoff utid trample on
euch other ;.but oh, tis bitter wrong that
they should drag mother, wile and sister
from her higher shrino to crush her in
tho dust! Sixteenth Amendment!
Woman's shame ? Not that alone.
When tho act is done which proclaims
woman has entered the political arena to
contest fur position and power, it will bo
the final deed?the last signuture to the
death-warrant of a once glorious nation.
Ah truly indeed, may the poet siug,
??Fold that banner, for '*lia weary."
?^fSs, fold it?'drape it in mourning ?~
wreathe it in crape, for the nation is
dead !
Strange, passing strange, that woman
should contend for power ; should so far
forget her self-respect und duty ns to
stand before a gaping, curious crowd,
and with her woman * voice cry out for
equal rightt! Equal rights! For what?
To be trodden under foot? To ho jostled
and jeered by a noisy, clamorous mob?
Think you, Oh, deluded creatures, to
save the already tottering fabric of
governmcut? Vain delusion ! for with
the power of equal rights the old, sweet
influence of woman is forever gon?!
Will the rude, drunken creature wrang
ling at the ballot box heed the reproot
from the voice beside him in the noisy
crowd? Will he not rather lift his baud
to strike the reprover? Not cowardly?
as for a man to raise his hand against u
woman?but as muu to man ; for with
her equal rights she must accept the
cruel taunt, and hear the harsh and
wicked words, or lift her woman's hand
iu soil-defense. Wiiut prompts those
culling themselves women to demand
umong tue urchives of the nation there
shall be placed one law giving to them
such privileges us only men should claim?
Is it ambition ? Heed not the siren
voice; it will prove but u "Will o' the
Wisp," leading you through sodden
marshes into tho fatal quicksand. Do
not strong met) go down fa.ot and weary?
See them fulling by the wayside/ The
soiled and tattered banuer ou which they
hud traced, in joyous hope, "Excelsior,"
trailing in the dust?a bruised aud
crushed form beside them?seen too late.
In their haste and upward gazing, iu
their earnest, reaching for the "castles in
the air," they saw not the beautiful
flowers at their feet, heeded not the
pleading form and yearning heart, n.nd
in striving for fame und power, happiness,
was lost, and as they full tho truth of all
they might have been floats around and
away from them into tho "nameless

wrecks of barks guided by strong hands.

	<text>lAn Ambivalent Celebration
Fed. Income Tax 50th Year
| S
As taxpayens begin their annual skirmishes with Form ‘
1040, they may wish to note, if not celebrate, the 50th anni
versary of ine constitutional change that cleared the way to
a federal income tax. :
~ February 2, 1513, is the date when the 16th Amendment
authorizing Congress ‘“to lay and collect taxes on ineome l
from whatever source derived” was proclaimed by the Sec
retary of State as part of tie Constitution. Fsllowing adop
tion by Congress in 1909, approval by % of th> ilaces was
completed early in 1913.
This Amendment was consider
ed necessary after the U.S.
Supreme Court struck down the 2
per cent income tax of 1894 be
cause it was a direct tax, and
under the Constitution required
“to be apportioned among the
states in accordance with popu
lation.”
By eliminating the need for
apportionment with specific ref
erence to an income tax, the 16th
Amendment cleared up the situa
tion and left no doubt that an
income. tax would- pass the test
of basie constitutionality.
Several months later, on
Qctober 3, 1913, the first in- |
come tax under the new power
became law. The basie rate for
individuals was just 1 per cent
with a personal - exemption of
S4OOO for a married person and
- S3OOO for a singie person. In
come of mere than $20,000 was
subject to a 1 per cent surtax, |
with a top surtax of 6 per cent.
The corporate rate was 1 per
cent. This income tax law was
ruled valid by the Supreme
Court in 1916. ¢
Considering the montks of de
liveration devoted to tax legis
lation these days, the income tax
amendment got speedy action in
Congress way back then Presi
dent Taft recommended the am
endment to Congress on June 16,
i 909. Less than a month later,
on July 12, the proposal had won
approval in both Senate and
House,
; The Resolution was adopted
by the Senate without a dissent
i iwg yuee. o the House, the Bill
| was reported and adopted that
i same day after four hours de
bate. Ome Congressman, Champ
\ Clark of Missouri. said during
| the deliberations “that wit of
man never devised a fairer or
juster tax tham a graduated in
‘ come tax.”
{ Such swift action on an im
portant measure was attributed
to the widely held belief that 34
of the states would not ratify the
amendment. Others held the view
that an income tax would be im
posed only in time of war,
Both of these assumptions
proved to be wrong. Alabama
ratified the amendment 'in: 1909
and by 1913, the 36th and 37th
states, Delaware and Wyoming,
‘ added their approval, making 34
of the 48 states then in the Union.
This paved the way for the
modern income tax, which as we
all know, has been with us for
« U years — in peace ‘and war.

	<text>In the House of Representatives on the
4th inst. Mr. Julian, of Indiana, presented
a new amendment to the Constitution of
the United States:
“ Section 1. —The right of Citizens of
the United States to vote shall not be de
nied or abridged by the United States, cr
by any State, on accounc of sex.
Sec. 2—Congress shall have power to
enforce this article by appropriate legis
lation.”
Slavery of the negrn being abolished,
why not abolish Slavery of woman ? The
black man being enfranchised by the
15th amendment, why not enfranchise
woman by the 16th amendment 9 What
more appropriate to follow the enfran
chisement of a race, deprived of rights on
account of color, than the enfranchise
ment of .voman, deprived of rights on ac
count of sex ? As right has prevailed in
the one case, it is sure to prevails and at
no very distant day, in the other. Let us
have the 16th amendment.</text>

	<text>WHITE STAR LINE TO BUILD BIGGEST SHIPS YET PROJECTED
By Associated Press.
LIVERPOOL. April Two new
White Star liners which will be the
largest vessels yet projected will be
laid down at Belfast next June. The
exact measurements of the steamers
have not been given out/but they will
be over 840 feet In length, 78 feet in
breadth and with a gross tonnage of
45,000, or 50,000.
The ships are to be fitted with com
bination turbines and reciprocating
engines guaranteed to maintain a
speed of twenty-one knots. The names
of the vessels are to be Olympic and
Titanic. '.'./.-</text>

	<text>ONE MILLION FOR A STARTER
After an expenditure of J1.C00.000 the great stee!
j double gantry which will bo the cradle of th» larg
! est two steamship In the world ha« been finished
I at the shipyards of Harland & "WoifT. at Belfast.
Ireland. The steamers whose keel blocks haT»
I been laid side by side in this the biggest gantry
j In the world are the Titanic and th« Olympic, of
| the White Star Line, and within a year or two
I these leviathans will b« running between New Tori*
! and Southampton.
Soon after the two fast Cunarders. too Lusl-
I taria and the Mauretania, had demonstrated that
I one could travel in luxury and at a very high
i speed through tha agency of turbine engines. th«
White Star X-in» announced that it would build
two steamers to beat the Oinarders la length and
breadth, and perhaps In other ways also. It was
reported at the tim» that th« new Whlta Star
■ liners would be a thousand feet in length, but sub
sequently it was officially announced that they
i would bo 900 feet lons, with a beam of ninety feet.
j When It was decided to build them it was found
' that there was no gantry In thm world big enough
! to accommodate such monsters, and It was then
. that H&rland & Wolff began to rip up three of Its
', largest gantries and build the hug* steel and con
' crete cradle that Is now ready to bold th* Olympic
• and the Titanic.
Before th* steel structure which supports th*
i powerful electric travailing cranes was erected a
' big concrete base, twenty fret thick, was built upon
sp!le3 driven fifty fe«t into tha ground. The con
crete foundation, in addition to being more firm
than the regular earthen base, has the advantage
of cleanliness, an 1 tools and materials which mar
fall from the cranes la the course of construction
may be found more readily. Parts of deck fittings
end tools have fallen into the ground la gantries
with earth bases and have not been recovered
' until the vessel has gilded from Its cradle into the
: water.
The construction of the Olympic has been started.
' The keel of the Titanic will be laid soon, and
' visitors to the shipyards at Belfast will have an
opportunity of seeing the simultaneous csnstrcs
. tion. side by side, of the largest two steamers tn
; the world. The gantries are so built that any
piece of material, however heavy or awkward, may
[ be placed and held In whatever position the con
atructora desire. The gantries themselves are more
than a thousand feet in length. 3C3 feet high and
something more than two hundred feet la -Ki&X

	<text>The Titanic and the Olympic W3l
lie Largest Steamships in World.
Although what will be the largest two steamships
In the world, the Titanic and the Olympic, of the
White Star Line, are mere skeletons just now in
their Lie million-dollar double gantry at Belfast,
Ireland the marine architects know exactly bow
they are going to look when they start on their
maiden passage to this port. From the plans and
specifications the designers have made a wush
drawing showing bow 'he monsters will look when
In the water and ready to sail. Although at nrst
glance the illustration suggests the Isauretania and
Lusitania. with their four gigantic funnels, there
Is something in the appearance of the new levia
thans that Is typical of a White Star steamship.
The great height of the new liners and the broad
sweep of the bridge elves some idea of their 80.J80
tons displacement. The builders have almost elimi
nated the old cusr im of carying masts, «nd In this
respect the targesi ships in the world resemble the
Old Dominion steamers, tha smallest passenger
carrying vessels in the American coastwise service.
All the old Dominior Mners have only one mast.
■ • . g the 1 ■ '

Thrse tw< vessels are being built simultaneously
sid* by side In a steel gantry that was begun a
year before the keels were laid, and which cost
over a million dollars. The new liners will each
n«» S» feet long, with ■ 92-foot beam. The unusual
beam la equivalent to the length of some of the
fast utenrn yachts of this port. The Olympic and
Titanic will iw» read] for the New York. South

The new liners will be as complete In

An automatic device on the bridge will
control all these heavy steel door
making It possible for a single hand to
close them all In case ot danger Each
of these doors In turn will be electric
ally connected with a chart on the
bridge and wIn be represented by small
electric lights When one or these
doors closes the light will burn red The
officer on the bridge will thus be ahl
to see at a lance If all of the com
partments are closed Still another set
or safety devices will guard against
fire In every part of the ship
A combination of turbine and recIpro
cating engines will propel the vessels
It Is expected that a great economy
or coal will be effected by this ar
rangement The berths In Harland

	<text>TITANTIC SAILS ON HER FIRST VOYAGE
White Star Liner the Largest
Vessel that Ever Sailed
the Seas.
(National News Association)
LONDON, April 10. Carrying 1400
passengers the liner Titanic of the
White Star line, than which there is
no larger vessel afloat, sailed from
Southhampton today on her maiden
voyage bound for New York. The Tt
tanic which is of 45,000 tons displace
ment Is sister ship to the Olympic.
All the special suites of rooms in
stituted as an innovation in the Titan
ic were occupied when the passage be
gun. These suites consist of bed
rooms, sitting room, bath room, and
servant's room and have their own
private deck promenade isolated from
the rest of the ship and not overlooked
by any other passengers.
The Titanic also possesses another
new feature in its Louis XVI. restaur
ant. Her sister ship the Olympic, also
has this feature but on a smaller
scale. It proved so popular, however,,
that the White Star company decided
to have Jhe one on the Titanic greatly
enlarged. Adjacent to it is a special
reception room for the use of passen
gers taking meals in the restaurant.
The Titanic while its engineering
principal is the same as that of the
Olympic, is expected by experts on
navigation to make faster time than
the Olympic because of a slight dif
ference in the curvature of the propel
ler blades. .</text>

Consider Bruce Ismay, ship

coward !
On that awful moment when it

was known that the great Titan
ic, man's proudesl triumph of
shipbuilding-, was doomed to go
to the bottom, the MEN aboard
her stood aside to give .the wom
en first chance of life.
The MEN stood asidej But
Bruce Ismay did not. He was
one of the first in the ,boats
among the women and the chil-
dren, the helpless ones whose '
right to life lies in their helpless
ness. ,
And he was part owner of this
ship that was to carry 1,500 liv-:
ing souls to death in the icy wa
ters pf the Great Banks. He was
responsible for the building of the
Titanic. He was responsible for
the rate at which the Titanic was
being forged ahead through the'
dangerous, ice-strewn seas.
The captain of the ship went
down with his vessel, according
to the inexorable law of the sea.
But Bruce Ismay, the owner,
who was over the captain, was
among the first in the 'boats.
The White Star officials have
tried to explain this, and have
made a pitiful mess of doing so.
They say Ismay had to go so
there would be someone in au
thority over the boats.
How could Ismay take charge
of the boats? What did Ismay
know of the angry sea, of the
proper precautions, of naviga
tion, that would make him more
than a burden in the boats?
There wefe officers of the Ti
tanic, men who knew what was
needed, to take charge of the life
boat fleet.
And now, Ismay the coward
is going to run away. It is re
ported that he has sent a wireless
from the Carpathia to the Cedric
of the White Star line. The Ced
ric soon is to start for, England. '
Ismay's wireless orders the
captajp pf the Cedric to wait in

from the Carpaihia to the Cedric

Mr. Ismay said that the ships of tho

"Was any officer of your company
on the trial trip of the Titanic?" asked
Senntor Smith
"Yes, sir Mr. Andorson. general

other director."
The witness told of mail contracts
with the British government, but dp
nied thcro was anything in the con
tract calling for high speed.
"Is there any minimum speed?"
''Yes," I think that we are not al
lowed to put mails on a ship that
makes less than 1C knots an hour,"
Mr. Ismay replied.
Senator Smith questioned tho wit
ness at length as to the details of the
mall contracts. Tho witness declared
that tho mall bounty was so small in
itself that it "would not induce any
one to build big ships "
Lost Three Ships.
"How many ships has your com

Smith
"The only ones that I can remem
ber are tho Republic, the Maronlc and

added that the fate of the Maronic
had never been cleared up.
"Can you gie this committee infor
mation on what you expected to earn,
gross and net, with the Titanic?"
"We never figured it out."
Senator Smith aBked if a limit of
cost had been placed on the building
of tho Titanic
"None whatever," 'said Mr Ismay.
"Tho builders are given carte blanche.
They go ahead and build on their own
plan as passed upon by us and when
the ship Is completed they add on
their percentage of profit, which we

construction four or five years before
you need her."
Ismay Ordered Ship Built.
"Who of your company directed
Harland and Wolff company to build
tho Titanic'"
"I did," was tho answer "It was
in a conversation with Lord Perry, I
ordered the Olympic and the Titanic
at the same time I told him that we
wanted tho very largest and best ships
possible to produce irrespective of
cost"
Mr. Ismay said another sistor shin

so it was believed Until yotctd.iy.
One who has looked into modern meth-
ods for safeguarding a vessel of the Ti
tanic type can hardly imagine an acci
dent that could cause her to founder.
No collision such as has been the fate
ui may snip in recm years u nns ; enii
thought up to this time, could send
her down, nor could running against an
Iceberg do It unless such an accident
were coupled with the remotely possible
blowing out of a boiler. She would sink'
at once probably if she were to run over
a submerged rock or derelict In such
manner that both her keel plates and
her double IsMtom were torn away for
more than half her length; but such a
catastrophe has so remotely possible that
it did not even enter the Held of con- '
Jecture.
The reason for all this is found in the .

including the largest, could be flooded

Probably it was tho

It was said of the Titanic that her com
partments could li" 1ood I as far back
or as far forward ns the eugin room anil
she would float, though she might tak on
a heavv list, or settle considerably at one
end. To provide against ju-t such an
accident as Sjh is said to have encountered
she had set kick a good distance from thn
Ikiwb iui extra hoavy rns pattilion known
as the collision hulkhe-id. w.'ncli would
prevent waHT getting in amid-hlp-. even
though a good part of her bow i-hould
b torn away What a ship can stand and
still tloat was shown a fow years ago when
the Sucvic of the White Star line went on
the ivx'ks fpii thn Hritili coist. The
wreckeis could not move thn forward
purt of h"r, so they separated hr into
two sections by thn use of dynamite, and
after putting in a tempoiary bulkhe.id
floated off tho after half of the ship, put
it in dry dock and built a new forward
part for her. More recently the battle,
ship Maine, or wiiat was left of hor, was
floated out to sea, kept on top of thn water
only by her water tight compartments.
Probably if th tw'o ships lost 'mentioned
liad been equipped with modern bulk
heads in thn numler with which modern
shlpsare built they might never have sunk.
In building thn Titanic many other
devices wern provided for tho sifety ol"
twssengers and crew. Them was, Tor
Instance, the double bottom. On tlm
outside of the ship was a layer of mild
steel plating onn and one hair inches
thick, which, while no match for icels'rgs,
was calculated to withstand almost anv
other strain that could l nut on it. Willi
In this shell was another layer of plating,
not bo thick, but or sufficient stiength In
withstand gro it mfc-m should thn outer
plsllng ! torn away.
'I hen thero were submarine signals
to tell or nearby vessels or shores. This
signal arrangement includes a small
lank on either side or the vesel just below
ths vater line Within .tch is a micro
phone with wires leading to thn hridge.
If the vessel is uar any other or approach
ing shorn. the sounds conveyed through
the watT from the dispirit object am
beard through the receiver nf thn micro
phone These arrangements are called
tho ship's ears, and whether thn sounds
com" fiom one side or th" vessel or tho
other, the offleers can tell th" location
of the shore or ship near by. If both ears
record th object is ahead.
Steamship companies, realizing that
even despite their precautions their
ships may rounder, have gone so rar as
to provide against loss or passengers
and crow oven In this event. Km
itiWostlni' woro tho Titatilc's small boats
nnd boat davits, which as well nH forming
attractive decoration to the Dig vessel
seem to have proved their usefulness.

Some of tho worst calamities in past
steamship accidents have happened from
me innnlllty or me crews to nnnmn inn
boats tiicolv between thn deck Hnd thn
water. On thn Titanic there was no chance i
to bundle matter, for the davits were

SMITH'S OLYMPIC MISHAP.
Collision Willi thr llnnkr In Which 1
Tltanlr'a t'nptnln 1'lnared,
("apt, Smith, affectionately called by
his associates Ted Smith, was in com
mand of tho Titanic's sister ship, the
Olympic, when bho was in collision with
the British proteoted cruiser Hawko
in the Solent on September 2(1 last year.
The Hawke camo steaming out of Ports
mouth and drew alongside the giantess.
According to some of the passengers
on tho Olymplo the Hawke swerved in
the direction of the big liner and a moment
later tho bow of tho Hawke was crunch
ing steel plates in the starboard quarter
of the Olympic, making a thirty foot
hole in her. Sho was several months
in dry dock.
Tlm result of a naval court inquiry
was to put all the blninelfor tho collision ,
on tho Olympic. Capt. Smith, in his
testimony liefore the naval court, said
that be was on tlm bridge when hn saw
the Hawke overhauling him. Thn Olym
pic began to draw ahead later or the
Hawke drop astern, tho captain did not'
know which. Then tho cruiser turned
very swirtly and strucK the Olympic at
right angles on, the quarter. Thn pilot
gavn the signal for the Olympic to norf.
which wns to minimize the force of the
collision. Thn Olympic's engines had
been stopped by order ol the pilot.
Up to the moment the Hawdto swerved.
Capt Smith said, he had no anxiety.
The pilot, Iiowyer, corroborated the tes
timony of ('apt. Smith. That the line
did not believe Capt. Smith was at fault
notwithstanding tho verdict, of the board
of naval inquiry . is shown byhis relenllon

HOW THE REPUBLIC SANK
L
The First Groat Rescue by Aid
of Wireless on Jnnunry
2.1, IDOO.
FASRKXHERS MOVED TWICE
.Turk Binns's "C Q I)' Brought
the Hnltie Tlirouprh Fopr to
Her Sister Ship.
Early in th morning of Saturday,
January 2.1. IBM. tho White Star liner
Baltic, which was ready to lend a hand
yesterday to the brolten Titanic, was
rounding the Nantucket Sholas lightship,
Inlio'jnd. Kog lay so heavily on the
Atlantic that oil ships were moving war
ily, knowing that others wero shoulder
to shoulder with them in tho crowded
trafflo ways, so dangerously near that
deadly harm might he done before a
helmsman could edge off hi ship to es
cape a blow. A few minutes beforo 6
o'clock the Baltic's wireless man heard
something through tho fog which made
I the ship turn about and go off on the
same errand that she undertook yesterday.
Whit Jack Tattersall, th wireless
' operator. h-rd was that the White Star
Line's steamship Republic, off for a cruke
in the Mediterranean, had been struck
hy tho Florida, an Italaian ship, and was
ln danger of s'nking. The big Baltic
fo,-got about the fog and went off full
tilt in search of her stricken sister.
It was i long chase. Tho Baltlo went
to the point on the map which the R-s-pulblc's
wireless man had indicated
latitude 40, longitudn "u - but the Republic
was not there. rhc air was full of wire
less mesage. Slasconset was trying
to reach tho Republic, a oz.en other ships
were trying to reach the Republic and
Jack Blnns, the Republic's operator,
vas trying to answer. The wireless
tangle was complete. But at last Tatter
sall heard from Binns that the Baltic was
very close: so closo indeed that she ought
to see the Republic's rockets.
But the fog was still heavy and the
Baltic could not make the Republic out.
She crept in the direction Binns suggested
until n warning crackled in Tattereall's
car:
"You are too close to us for safetylt"
The Baltic eased off her speed to mere
seaway, sounding hor wh istle. Capt.
Sealhy on the bridge of tho Republic heard
the screech through the fog and was ablo
to send wireless directions uactc to Cupt.
Hanson of the Baltic. In a little while
Tattersall heard .I'inns say:
"Steer east southeast. Listen to our
bells."
Then in a minute camo other steering
orders, fast on one another's heels: "Steer
northeast" and "Steer southeast." At
almost the samo instant he caught a
message, from the Cunarder Lucanlt
which sent chills up and down his hack:
"Siasconset says: 'Hear from Republic.
Says to Raltic to hurry. Sinking fast.' "
And then, at r o clock in the evening,
twelve hours after she first picked up word
that the Republiq was in trouble, tho
Baltlo pushed aside tho fog that cloaked
. the Republic and came alongside. Capt.
Hanson asked Capt. Sealby of the Repub
lic to eomo aboard, but the Republic's
captain refused. Farlier in tho day ho
had sent his passengers aboard tho Flor
ida, and later had also sent hto crow across
to the Italian ship too, in order to bo on
tho right Bide of safety.
I Two hours attor Capt. Hanson had
made out the Republic and tho Itillan
ship which had hurl her ho began to fakn
passengers off tho Florida and give them

day and the stories they told when theycanw
safely ashore at Now York two days lator
showed that tho strain of two boat trips'
from ship to ship on the, rolling Atl.inlw
was hard to endure. Seven-tenths of tin
Republic's first cabin passengers wer
women, many off to the Mediterranean to
rest. Tho passengers of the TPania were,
more fortunate, for they had to undergo
only a single transshipment.
It had taken about ten minutes for
Tattersall on the Baltic to get word from
the Republic that she had been struck
The Republic was about 1 miles to th
southeast of Nantucket and was alrcnrbr
swinging on the great circle which would
take her to the .Vores. the first land on
her voyage to the Mediterranean. Capt,
William I. Sealby. who had worked rnr thi
White Star I ine nil his life, had staved en
the bridge all night and wns looking fftr
tile first streaks of gray light in the lunks
or fog.
The first Intimation he got that another
hip was near nt hand wns the tolling of
a bell. So inuff'ed was It in the fog that
he could not toll from what direction it
came. He passed the word to his quarter
master to sound tho whistle, on Ions
unbroken screech as a last note of warn
ing. The answer was immediate. The
shriek of a ship's whistle cam1 throuah
thn fog, and while the sound of it was
still hanging in thn air Sealby's eye picked
nut a blur to port that was darker than
the fog itself. Signals flashed to tlm en
gine room that Capt. Sealby wanted the
Republic's engines sent astern at top
speed, nnd then he lot go a shriek nf his
whistle, meaning that the stranger ehouli
pass on the port side.
But she camo straight on and struck
thn Republic heavily, a little aft of mid
ship on the port. side. Her how sank into
the Republic's side, crushing steel wallt,
working into .the engine room and smash
ing Ave staterooms. In tho half hour
that followed the shock nobody aboard
the Ropuhllo knew whether the ship was
foing to stand up under the blow or not.
he water that poured into thfl engine
room stopped the dynamos nnd tho ship
wan as dark as a pocket from stem to
stern.
When the passengers got back to New
York they had nothing but praise for the
conduct of tho crew. In tho trying mo
ments after tnn collision the stewards
and stewardesses did their level best to
keep the pnssengcrs' nerves from getting
tho better of them. Capt. Sea I by' ordered
all hands on deck and dressed the passen
gers in Hto preservers. Onco out of their
staterooms tho orders were that none
sbould go back again, and the passengers
wore what clothes tho stewards brought
them or what they gathered in their
arms when tirst they camo out into the
night.
At tho end of the first half hour, when
It was clear that tho Republic was no
going down immediately but that hr
wound was serious, Capt. Sealhy brdred
tho passengers to get ready for th trip
across to tho Florida. The transship
ment was liegun'at 8 o'clock. The Florid 1
was lying about l.ono feet from the Re
public, her broken nose pointing to th"
west. It took three hours to transfer thn
Republic's 1.600 pas&cngcrri to the Italian
ship, thirty in n boatload. .
And then when tho Baltic cime along
side tho transfer wan made again, a
record of two transshipments at sea in a
single day, which steamship' 'men said
had never been brokon. Tho passengers
were brought back to Now York on the
Baltic, which camo up the bay in simshino
the folllowing Monday morning.
Two imssengers aboard tho Republic,
were killed W. J. Mooney, president
of tho Mooney State Bonk of Uitigdcn,
S. D., and Mrs. Kugeno Lynch, wife or a
liquor dealer in Boston. Several others
were liadly hurt. Three sailors on thn
Florida wore killed.
The Republic stayed above the water
until nlxiut 8 o'elock on Sunday eveniiip.
Capt. Sealby nndR. J. Williams, the
second officer, stayed by her until sho
sank. She went down in thirty fathoms
of water off No Man's Iand, a dot of rock

?tor. "It shows that the White Star
people had information about the fate
of the Titanic hours before they made it
public.-'
"Did the message refer ta an attempt
to reinsure the Titanic . "
"I cannot say now," the senator re
plied.
Mr. Franklin, when Senator Smith re
turned to the committee room, rose and
suggested that the committee call upon
the Western Union to produce the mes
sage.
/ "Do you waive ell your rights of se
crecy in this matter as you did In the
other yesterday?" asked the senator.
??Absolutely." said Mr. Franklin. "We
want this matter sifted to the bottom
and we want you to have every wireless
message, telegram and cablegram sent or
received that has any bearing on the dis
aster."
With this information Senator Smith
returned to his own room to press the
witness further.
Ismay Again on the Stand.
When Mr. Ismay took the stand Sena
tor Smith asked him what was the num
ber of his stateroom on the Titanic.
"1 think it was ."Ml on 'B' deck," said
Mr. Ismay.
"How loHg have you been manager of
the International Mercantile Marine?"
"Since W04."
"What are your duties?"
"General control of the International
Mercantile Marine."
"And its constituent companies?"
"Yes, with exception of the Levland
line. That company has Its own man
agement and diiectors, but we control the
stock.",
"The steamship Oalifornian is one of the
ships of the Ley land line?" the senator
continued.
"Yes, sir."
How many steamship lines are under
control of your company?" the senator
asked. "In naming them, I wish you
would give their ports.'
"The American line, the Atlantic Trans
port line, the White Star line, New York
? o IJverr>ool, New York to Southampton,
Liverpool to Australia: Liverpool to New
Zealand: New York and Boston to tbe
Mediterranean; Mississippi and Dominion

line. Montreal to Liverpool and Aden:
Leyland line, Boston to Liverpool, Lon
don. West Indies. South American ports
and New Orleans; Red Star line. New
York to Antwerp, Boston, Philadelphia
and Baltimore. I think that's all I can
remember."
"Any lines to BraaH?''
"No. sir."
The witness said that the ships of the
varioua lines aggregated about 1,000,000
tons. He added that the investments of
the company were almost entirely In ships
and property necessary to their conduct.
"Was any officer of your company on
the tri? trip of the TKarrtc?" asked Sen
ator Smith. *1
"Tea. air. Mr. SanderKOft, g*rt?ral man
ager, and a director of the White Star
Hine, and also Mr. Greenfell, another di
rector."
Tells of Mall Contracts.
, The witness said that none of the com
pany's ships was in the British naval re
serve. He told of mall contracts with
the British government, but denied that
there waa anything in the contract calHng
'for high speed.
"Is there any minimum speed"
* "Yes. I think that we are not allowed
to put maila on a ship that makes lesa
than sixteen knots an hour," Mr. Iamay
??Have yon any mail contract with the
government of the United States? '
"The American line has a contract, l
think they get $4 per mile for mail serv
ice between New York, and Southamp
ton." That was the only American con
tract he knew of.
"Is there any speed condition In tne
United States government mall contract.
"I am not conversant with that, said
Mr. Ismay. He told of another mall con
tract with Canada which brought
ship for carrying mails between Quebec
>nd Liverpool. The British mall con
tract, he said, was subject to cancel
lation at any time on twelve mOntha
ttotice.
- Senator Smith questioned the wltneaa at
Jength as to the details of the mail cojt
dract?. The witness declared that the
%na!l bounty was so small that in itself
j-would not induce any one to build big
*h"How many ships has your company
Jost since you have been managing di
rector?" asked Senator Smith.
* "The only ones that I can remember
'are the Republic and the Naronlc and, or
course, the Titanic," said the ?witness,
;who added that the fate of the Naronlc
'never had been cleared up.
"Can you give the committee what you
expected to earn, gross and net. with
the Titanic?" the witness waa asked.
"We never figured it out."
Builders Given Tree Hand.
Senator Smith asked if a limit of cost
had been placed on the building of the
Titanic. _
"None whatever." said Mr. Iamay. "The
Guilders are given carte blanche. They
go ahead and build on their own plan as
passed upon by us, and when the shtp
is completed they add to their percent
age of profit, which we pay. In building
a ship you begin Its construction four or
live years before you need her."
"Who of your company directed the
Harland & Wolff Company to build the
Titanic?" asked Senator Smith.
"I did, sir."
"What did you say to them when you
ordered the shtp?"
"That's difficult to say. and It waa in
a conversation with Lord Perry. I or
dered the Olympic and Titanic at the
same time. I told him that. we wanted
?the very largest and beat ships possible
?to produce. Irrespective^of cost.
"Were yon all over the Titanic.
"I was never anywhere on the sntp
that other flrst-clasa passengers did not
co I had Intended to inspect her mi
nutely, but had not got to it yet."
Mr. Iamay said another sister shtp to
the Olympic is now kuilt
- Asked if he had conferred with J. W.
Andrews of the shlpbuildingcompany on
the Titanic, Mr. Ismay said he had on
one occaelon. ...
?He dined with me one night and *?d
the thought the writing room was too
?large and should be changed.
< One Conference With the Captain.
"Did you confer with Capt. Smith on
rthe trip?"
"Only once did I confer with him. 1
saw him frequently."
"Were you ever on the bridge?
"Not till after the accident. Then 1
was on the bridge about ten minutes.
"Did you see the captain there?" "
"Yes After the collision, when I went
up on the bridge. I asked the captain and
he said we'd struck ice.'
"I believe you said you dined wlOi the
ship's surgeon Sunday night, April 14.
the senator said. ? ..
"Yes. Dr. O'Loughlln dined with me.
? Where did Capt Smith dine Sunday
H'Tn 'the restaurant," s^ld Mr.Ismay. "I
think he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Wlde
ner. Mr. and Mrs. Carter and others.
?Was Msj. Butt there.
??I did not see him.
'?t^ left'the room* about 8 o'clock and
with the captals at all?"
"Vc*. on Friday night. After dinner 1
did not see him. I played bridge after
that."
"Have you known Capt. Smith a long
time?"
"Yea. a great many year*. He's been
in command of our ships for yeara."
The witness said Capt. Smith had been
In command of the Olympic, Baltic, Adri
atic and the old Brittannlc.
"I don't know all of the ships he was in
command of," he added.
"Was he in good health on the trip from
Southampton?" asked Senator Smith.
"So far as I know he was." The wit
ness added that the captain was about I
?sixty-two years old. !
Provision for Safety.
Asked as to the provisions for safety
taken in building the Titanic, Mr. lsmay
said that although there were no longi
tudinal 'bulkheads, the vessel had a dou-1
ble bottom. [
"It was the desire." he said, "to have
a ship that would float with her two
longest watertight compartments crashed
and full -of water." I
He said that if the Titanic had hit the I
Iceberg bow on it might not have sunk. I
In response to a question he said that
although the Titanic had been built for
the north Atlantic trade it had not been I
constructed with especial reference to the
strengthening of the bow.
Senator Smith asked the cost of the
vessel.
"About $7,500,000, sir," said the witness, I
who added that It was insured for f5,-1
000.000.
"Do you know of any attempt to in- I
crease the insurance Monday, April 15?" I
"I can't Imagine any one connected with I
the company attempting such a dlshon- I
orable act." said Mr. lsmay, with em- I
phasis. He added with equal emphasis I
that he had made no such attempt, and
no one connected with him or his com
pany had made the effort, so far as he
knew.
, "I don't want you to understand me to I
assert that such an effort was made," I
said Senator Smith.
"No, I don't, but the suggestion was I
such a horrible thing," said Mr. lsmay.
"Did you communicate with London or I
New York about the sinking of the ship?" I
Message Announcing Wreck.
"Yes, on Monday morning, shortly after!
I got on 'the Carpathia, the captain asked 1
me If I did not think I ought to send a J
message about the sinking of the Titanic. J
I said yes, and wrote a short message to
MT. Franklin, in New York. I showed it
to the captain, and said: 'That's about
all I can say,' and he said 'yes.' He took
It away and sent It. That was Monday J
morning, AprU 15. Mr. Franklin never
got It until April 17. In that message 11
said (Mr. lsmay reading): 'Deeply regret
advise you Titanic sank this morning
after collision with an iceberg. Great
loss of life. Further particulars later.' " I
Mr. lsmay then reread Into the record I
all the messages that passed between him I
and Vice President Franklin while the 1
former was on the Carpathia.
After reading the messages, all of
which have been printed. Mr. lsmay said:
"That is all the communication I had."
"At that time you intended to leave
immediately for Liverpool as soon as you
landed In New York?" Senator Smith
said.
"Yes. but at that time I had not the I
slightest idea of any investigation," Mr. I
lsmay replied.
"When did you first learn of it?"
"About five minutes after you came on
board the Carpathia in New York, sen-1
ator."
"Who told you?"
"Mr. Franklin told me. I think you I
came on the ship with him, didn't you?" I
"Well. I was following him closely," I
said Senator Smith.
Mr. lsmay was then asked about the I
i speed of the Titanic on the trip from I
I Southampton. He said he thought the I
revolutions had been worked up to sev-1
enty-flve, but he was not sure. That had I
not been worked out
"The engines were built for seventy-1
eight revolutions," he said.
"How many knots would that be?"
"I heard one gentleman say on the I
stand that she would make twenty-five |
knots. I want to say that all we ever ex- I
pected of the Titanic was that she should I
make the same speed as the Olympic. We 1
never intended she should be faster. Wei
had1 planned to have the Titanic go faster I
on Monday than she was on Sunday."
Did Not Talk of Speed to Captain. I
"Did you ever talk to Capt. Smith about |
the speed?"
"Never, air."
"Did you undertake in any way to direct |
the management of the Titanic after she
left Southampton?"
"Not at all, air. That would have been I
entirely out of my province."
Mr. lsmay said that he heard no reports 1
from the captain or any one else after
the accident concerning the extent of the I
damage. He said when he went to Capt. I
Smith. and asked him, the officer replied I
that he thought it "was serious."
"Did you hear any alarm given calling I
the passenger* on deck?" he was asked
"No, etr."
Pays Tribute to Commander.
Capt. Smith, he said, was selected to
command the pride of the seas because
of his experience and his high character.
"He was looked upon as our senior
commander," said Mr. lsmay. "He had I
an exceptionally clean record, one that
few captains on the Atlantic have." He]
added that Capt. Smith had had no acci-1
dents until last year, when the Olympic
collided with the British cruiser Hawk.
"That accident did not shake your faith I
in Capt. Smith?"
"Not at all, sir. If it had we would
not have placed him In command of ths
Titanic."
Mr. lsmay paid an equally high tribute!
to Chief Engineer Bell or the Titanic.
Neither he nor any of the assistant engi
neers were saved, he added.
Xors Lifeboats Ordered.
Questioned why the Titanic had only
twenty lifeboats, he said that was a mat- I
ter for the builder, and he supposed the 1
requirements of the British board of
trade were met. He thought the whole I
question of life-saving appliances and de- I
vices should be carefully considered, and!
when he returned to England he would
take up the matter.
"Are you willing to admit that you are
in favor of so increasing the number of I
lifeboats?"
"Perfectly. I have given instructions I
already that none of our ship* shall leave I
port without boats sufficient to care for
all the passengers, in increasing the
number of lifeboats we probably shall
have to make changes In the construc
tion of the ships. As It Is now, we will
have to cut down the number of passen
gers."
Regarding his departure from the Tl- I
tanic, he said that he left in the last ool- (
lapsible boat and < that there were no
women about. There were only about I
forty persons in the boat.
Senator Smith then asked him pointedly
what he did after he boarded the Car- I
pathla.
Defends Conduct on Carpathia.
"I understand that my conduct on!
board the Carpiathla has been severely
criticised," said Mr..lsmay. "I court the
fullest inquiry at the hands of the com
mittee. The facts in the case are these:
When I went aboard I was standing with
my back against a bulkhead when some
one came to me and said: 'Oo Into the
saloon and have a bite of something hot
or a drink.'
"He repeated It twice, but I told him I
would be happier If I could get off by my
self. He took me by the arm and led me
to a room, which proved to be the doc
tor's room. I was not out of there until
the Carpathia docked. I was 111. and ate
no solid food on the run Into New York.
"Right here I want to say that the
doctor did not occupy a suite. He had
one room. In which he slept. He did not
occupy It the first night 1 was in It. He
was busy with the Tltanlc's survivors,
but he dressed there.
"Mr. Jack Taylor was brought Into the
room the morning we got on the Carpa
thia. He was there some time.
People were coming and going through
this room a|l the time."
*'What can you say, Mr. lsmay, as to
the treatment you have been accorded by
this committee?"
"I have no criticism whatever to of
fer," said Mr. lsmay. "I waa naturally
disappointed in not being permitted to gS
home, but 1 suppose you had good reason
for keeping me here."
"Den'e you think now that such was the
wisest coujBte?"
"Yes, I flnnlc It was."
"Do you Know of any criticism that can

"None whatever."
His Only Bemarks About Speed.
Senator Burton asked Mr. Ismay if he
had any conversation with passengers on
the Titanic about the speed of the boat.
"j suppose you refer to the interview
with Mrs. Kyerson," Mr. Ismay said.
? The only thing that I remember saying
about the speed of the ship wm say In*
that it was my intention on Monday if
everything went well on deck and below
to try out the Titanic for five or *1*
hours to see what she could do. That s
all I remember of saying about it. Oi
course. Monday never came. j
Mr. Ismay denied that he had any con
versation with Capt. Rostron of the Car-^
pathia concerning messages to W YorK,
Liverpool or London, excepting "to
message announcing the accident ani4 "
dressed to the officers of the White Star
*'"I asked*for? no preferential treatment
for my messages," he said.
Senator Smith asked Mr. l!IW to re
turn in the afternoon as Senator Bourne
desired to interrogate him.
Lowe's Sobriety Not Questioned.
Before adjourning for lunch Senator
Smith said he desired to make a state
ment which he wanted to appear in the
record. It was to the effect that during
his examination of Fifth Officer Lowe a
few days ago he had asked him a ques
tion which questioned his reputation for
sobriety. ..
**T wash to say," said the senator,
"that I had no intention of c*8""*

sorry the misunderstanding arose.

Senate Committee Gives All But Box
ball Permission to 60.
The first stage of the Titanic Investiga
tion wai ended yesterday afternoon,
when the committee completed its ex
examination of the survivors of the crew,
except Officer Boxhall, and gave them ,
permission to return to their homes In j
Bngland.
Hugh Woolner of London, a passenger
on the Titanic, told the committee after
the luncheon recess yMterday afternoon
that the speed of the liner increased each
day, it making 314 miles one day and 3W
thRevolver shots were fired by Officer
Murdock. he said, to frighten men who
had taken possession of "^col
lapsible lifeboats aheafl of a ^owd of
women standing on the deck. He helped
to pull the men out of the boat.
"Have you any complaint about the dls
cisline of the crew or conduct of the
officers after the ship struck?" Chairman
^Absolutelyhnone,M replied the witness.
Harold Bride, surviving wireless oper
ator of the Titanic, who was called to
the stand next, said he had received
$1,000 for giving his story th? ^rec?
to a New York newspaper. He last saw
Capt. Smith on the bridge aa the bridge
was going Under the water.
Senator Smith asked regaling the an
swer of ther Frankfurt to the Titanic a
distress signal. The Frankfurt s first
Jiply was" "O. K. Will stand by." Then
the Frankfurt asked: "What is the mat
ter?" That was the last message from
the Frankfurt. The Frankfurt s position
was not obtained by the Titanic.
The Frankfurt a messages c*me td the
Titanic stronger than ths Carpatnla s
and therefore the witness thought the
Frankfurt was nearer.
"Well, if you had given your position
to tne Frankfurt," remarked
Smith, "there might have been a different
**"Yes, shV' was the admission of the
*Fourth Officer Boxhall, whose testimony
'was Interrupted when he became ill
early in the investigation, gave further
testimony about the "ship of mystery
seen from the decks of the Titanic ?s she
was sinking. He said that rockets were
not always a signal of distress, and that
passengers on the Callfornian mlght have
seen rockets from a ship not in distress
and mistaken them for the Titanic s
8i Senator Smith said he had evidence in
dicating that the Callfornian was only
fourteen miles from the Titanic and he
asked Officer Boxhall if he thought he
could have seen the Callfornian s lights.
I "I don't know," he replied. "Five
j miles is the greatest range the Britlah
'board of trade require ships lights to
show, but we know they can be seen
farther on cleat; nights such as that. But
II should think that we could not have
seen- the Callfornlan's lights that far that
! Wireless Operator Cottam of the Car
-athla admitted that he had received $750
for his story from a New York news
paper. but denied he had received any
order, Instructing him to kill message
containing Titanic story.
WICKERSHAM TAKES
I ACTION TO EXPEDITE 1
SUIT'S PROSECUTION
The prosecution of the anti-trust suit
sgalnst the International Harvester Com
pany, it is declared at the Department of
Justice, will be <lipedited as much as
possible. Because! of the importance of
the Issue, Attorney General Wickersham
will file a certificate of expedition. The
effect of this will be to remove the case
from the district couft of Misnetota to
the United tftates circuit court of apfteftlft
for the eighth circuit. This eliminates
the district court, and to that extent
hastens the issue on to the Supreme
Court of the United States, where it is
generally conceded the case will be flnally
determined.
The earliest possible date at which the
case can come to issue before Judges
Sanborn, Hook, Adams and Smith, com
prising the eighth circuit, is about Au
gust 5. The defendants must make their
appearance in court by June 3, and they
will have until July 1 to answer the pe
tition. The government must file its rep
lication by August 5. Under ordinary
circumstances the case will then be at
issue.
Today's suit follows the failure of ne
gotiations to reach a friendly settlement
of the case without recourse to a fight in
the courts.
Its filing was delayed because Mr. Wlck
ersham was anxious to afford the com
pany an opportunity to meet the govern
ment s demands. The company declined
to separate the McCormlck and Deering
companies in any scheme of reorganisa
tion. The corporation appealed for a
hearing by President Taft, which was
granted. Tha President, however, sus

ed him to file suit.
MUST 00 TO BRITISH COURT.
IT. 8. Iu No Jurisdiction Over Prop

Owing to the absence of any spe
cial treaty with Great Britain ov
ering the disposition of the effects
of American Citiaent who die on
a British ship on the high seas,
probably It will be impossible for the

relatives of the American victims of the
Titanic disaster to obtain possession of
any valuables found on the recovered
bodies.

	<text>Rovival of Rollor Skating
Forty or fifty roller skating
rinks have been built and opened
to the public in New England
New Jersey and other states with 1
in the year All are well patron
ized and their promoters believe
that this sport neglected for 20
years will again become popular
In the late 70s and early 80s roll
er skating almost attained the dig
nity of a national amusement No
person was too oldior too young
to use the rinks The hockey
games endurance races and exhi
bitions of fancy skating arranged
bv rink owners attracted big aud
iences for four or five years be
fore the popular appetite was sat
isfied
Then and almost in a moment
roller skating fell into disfavor
Only children clung to it and on
them it has never lost its hold
This sudden loss of popularity
was due simply to the fact that
the pastime was worked to death
for although a good many harsh
charges were made by solemn
moralists against it these never
could have killed it Now it is re
turning as a novelty with another
gene ration of pleasurcscekers to
appeal to but it is improbable
that it will ever regain the glory
it once had The outofdoors
cult has made great progress since
1885 and roller skating is an in
door game</text>

	<text>The Craze Has Come:A Roller Skating Rink Will Open March Third
It has been a long time coming,
many have thought, but it has arrived.
At least the preliminaries havo been
arranged for inaugurating tho "roller
skating craze" in Honolulu,
The Honolulu Skating Ilink Com
pany hag been organized bv a number
of young men. of whom Clifford Kim
ball is the business representative. A
skating boom has been in tho air for
somo timo and this ontcrpriso is its
culmination,
Having taken the Union Feed Co.'s
old warehouse at (jucen and Edinburgh
streets for u rink, tho company
will open it to the public on Saturday
evening, March 3. Lumber is already
on tho ground for tho skating floor. A
supply of skates is on tho wny. They
are or steel with ball bearings in fact
the type of skate in uso on the Coast
and in the roller skating rinks of New
York and Boston. On tho inauka siilo
of the building tho walls are to be
opened up for admitting the cool
breezes. This will make for comfort
in tho exhilarating sport. A lean-to on
tho Waikiki sido will bo fitted up. as a
ftr.injlaf nnrl. aiu uvMrtfofn.. fliAvn a
"Slsofjto be' a jiodnwator booth on the
premises, but ,no spirituous, malt or a
vinous liquor will bo sold. Arc lights
will bo -installed, which will make the
rink always brilliant.
Of course an admission feo will be
charged, as well as a skating feo. The
riuk will be run on a first-class basis,
in ehnrgo of a competent man. It is
believed by the promoters that tho
time for starling bucu a place of amusement
is opportune. For a long period
there has been' a dearth of popular entertainment
other than theatricals and
field Bports.
To tho younger generation of Honolulu
folks up to twenty-five years of
age skating will ba an absolute novelty,
for it is twenty years since tho
previous voguo of that amusement
here. And thero Is undoubtedly a
larger population of tlnW hankering
after that class of diversion, combining"
exorcise with rollicking fun, In Honolulu
now than then.
The craze will bo a pastimo, moreover,
for ninny onlookers of tho large
class who take enjoyment from seeing
others making joyful. At suitable intervals
there will bo masked or fancy
dress carnivals held for tho jollification
of tho town. In the former craze
theso wero highly successful features,
No doubt Bandmaster Bcrgcr will meet
me craze iiuiiwiiy aim uo prepared wmi ijn
special stunts of music for gala

Surely nothing else 'could set adult
human beings to going round and round
and round like this, singly and in pairs.
In a sort of speechless ocstacy., • .
Round and round and round — thslr
bodies swaying this way and that in a
strange rhythmic motion.
Round and round and round— sometimes
faltering, staggering, clutching frantically
at thin air. from fatigue or excess of emo
tion, no doubt.
Round and round and round— sometimes
suddenly falling with a crash or a thump
—according to the meagerness or ampli
tude of the structure of the beings—mo
mentarily overcome by exhaustion or
fervor perhaps; then struggling to their
feet again with wild gestures and frantic
efforts, unheeded by the speeding throng.
Devil-driven can they be, these madly
hurrying, swiftly gliding beings?
Round and round and round— urged ever
onward when their spirits seem to flag
and their limbs to las by the intoxicating
plinky-planky-plunk of the piano that
must be devil-played, even as the beings
are devil-firlven. for no visible fingers
press the keys that are uncannily lifting
up and dropping down, striking the notes
to which the hurrying throng; keep time.
Round and round and round— the young
and the old at»d those of middle life, never
speaking, never smiling, never laughing,
their eyes fixed In rapf gaze, perhaps
of adoration, or. celestial" contemplation ;
one or another now whirling and rushing
backward, as if taken with sudden vertigo
or touched with madness of despair or
joy. then whirling again and going for
ward as before, ever on and on and on.
As I sit at one side, alone, upon a chair,
among the tiers of empty chairs, alone
and unheeded by the speeding throng that
iaoks never to the right nor the left, but
ever Into some dim beyond. . I note that
the" came ' beings flash past my vision
again and again, -on an endless, :#mle33
journey, some steadily like the planets
ir: their orbits, others spasmodically dash
ing In and out among the rest. In erratic
course like comets.
I note, too, that when indeed brtngs
that have become familiar drop out, new
beings appear and the throng hurries on.
ever on and on and on, without diminu
tion of members or of speed.
Round and round and round they go
youths and maidens clasping hands and
swaying in unison; youths and maidens
gliding singly and seemingly unconscious
of each other; youths and maidens pursu
ing each other, overtaking and capturing
each other without losing one single
rhythmic beat of the curious gliding mo
tion.
Roi:nd and round and round they go —
the beings of middle life, male and fe
male, finely, with arms crossed behind
then or hands thrust deep into their
pockets, lost In meditation or the deli
rious joy of motion; fla pairs, supporting
each other In the onward struggle, mak
ing mighty effort and but small and tor
tuous progress.
Round and round and round they go—
even. the aged, the patriarchal males with
ba!d her ?s or white beards, the females
stout but determined, or those luckier'
ones whose gray locks and wrinkles must
be marked to belle the slendcrness of
their waists.
Round and round anG round they go— .
and darting In and out among them, with
waving arms and legs and a port of stud
led malice in their movements, are these
imps .sent' to iotment them, to lmp«-de
prnjrress and endanger limb and life, to
afflict them and make their penance more
real, or are they, indeed, as an extraor^ .
dinary indulgence and toleration would
fee-em to indicate, mercy the young of
Ihtir kind — the exub«rar»i. undisciplined
male young?
I note— irom my chair among the tiers
of empty chairs— that a. strange rumbling
accompanies the movement of these be
inc?. Even as I reared the great build
ing—can anything co hideous be a tem
ple?—l noted It and wondered.
Is it an undertone of groans and lamen
tations?
I look more closely. .
Surely these are little wheels, little sets
of wheels s'-'ch as are used for moving
about th<; furniture indwellings, the. tittle
t\ heels called casters, that are :fasiened
to their feet, even as- they! are .to th*.
icn oi beds and tables, and. desks and
particularly heavy chairs. It is these.llttle
wheels, 1 note, that make .the strange
Tumbling sound, and send* the. beings on
their eliding., curving dashes with which
thty s,wrep along annihilating distance. -
Wonderful! " Wonderful!
What can • thUs weird ' ceremony, this
m; r stic rite be? ' »
Is ,It that these beings of all ages and
conditions— for, I note the great and lowly
mingling here, even clutching at each
other— are doomed to glide In an eternal
rc.ee? V, ..". '': \u0084
Is it expiation or adoration. that drives
them round ' and round \u25a0 and round ? -..
. Could they slop if, they .would? »
Would they if they could r
This I «ay, would have been the form
my musings would nave taken, as I sat
lonely upon my chair. In -that wilderness
of «mpty chairs had I been a' visitor from"
Mars.
- But— not being a visitor • from Mars— l
am, even as ycu are, "wise to the game,"
and 1 know perfectly well that these, my^
ordinarily sane,' sound' and 'pfactfcal" fel
low beinre. somo of whom are the bank--
ers we leave our .money with for safe- %
keeping, others of whom . are the mer
chants and. the merchants' .clerks, we
spend our money with, are merely roller
skaters, reveling in ' the latest," maddest
f*d of a mad, mad world.
lam ncit, I say,' a victor from Mars,
yet so long as I remain on the side, stick
ing to ray chair in that wilderness v of .
empty chairs— and it takes both hands to
hold on and resist the tempiatJ6n of that
vortex-this !s what roller, skating looks
like to ny. and I haven't se<jn the weird-,
est of It yet.
1 haven't seen the Beginners' Pens!
I haven't hung over the rail and
watched the male beings initiated Into'
the first degree. •
I haven't sat on! a footstool and peeked
through the bars at the female novitiates
undergoing the ' trials cf the preliminary
ordeal.
Why 'is roller skating?
, Now that th\> question is popped at you,
you' can no more answer, it, I'm sure;
than -you, can answer that other profound
fjucry that Is' chiefly used to break .the
fbc-ial ice: ;
I Why Is an oyster?
Acd" what It is is as great a mystery as
why it is. \u25a0 >
- Roller skating in surely not a sport.
This going round and round and round
on little wheels In "a circumscribed, In
clcscu area Is.no more .like ice skating,
with Us freedom, and possibilities-, and
surprises and tingling exhilaration,' than ;
that mild nursery : concoction. called "canv"
brie tea is like the beverage that chee,rs. •
It surely. is not an athletic exercise/ for
\u25a0 !t combines .the maximum of speed with
*tbe. , . minimum of . exertion-^xcept, of '
course, in .the initiatory stages, where the
reverse i« true. ,' '. \ .' , : •

eeeins to even. the most unprejudiced 6pec-|
tator a solitary pleasure, or at.best.a
speechless ecstacy. for' two. "... '\u25a0'.\u25a0'•

If roller skating isn't a sport nor an ex
ercise, nor yeta diversion. It Is an intoxl
cant.iand that is why the whole world
has taken -to it— perhaps.
\u25a0 That Is, why the papa and the grandpapa

* "Bord well!** ejaculated Perkins. "What
ire you talking ; about?"
"He claims," -continued Higgins, "that
the' proprletcr of a suburban" laundry has
jpleridid'; opportunities for paying off
"grudges In ari innocent and unmaliclous
way, 'but that they must be seized by a
real genius In order to be made the most

Perkins. "Pray elucidate." wmM
"The] fellow, who runs the. mangling ap

Hlsglns, 5 ' "drives ; one.* of . his ' own wagons.

condescension has been 'maddening.; Re
cently i&l scries of . sniibs \u25a0 administered to
several iof i their " plebeian neighbors * made
the*^ altuaUon V almost ** unbearable.^ when
trouble, you may see Society in any on©
of the Beginners' Pens of any one of
the rinks persevering side by side with
the hoi polloi. striking out as wildly
.•with arms and feet, going down a3
clumsily, all of a heap, grinning aa
sheepishly when struggling to the feet
that usually tread exclusive 'ways,
"Mixing" democratically, too. and not
a little selfishly, for one pretty bud go
ing to her Pacific Heights home in a
Larkin-street car artlessly confided to
a friend, and the rest of us:
"I've just had the loveliest time at
the rink. I skated most of the evening
with a riveter.* he called himself, front
the Iron works. He's a splendid skater
— and his hands are as rough as — as—
bark. Tehee r
"He said he'd look for me next time ha
came.. Just fancy! Tehee!"-;"
And it wasn't a snobbish tehe«»! at all,
let me tell you, 1 but just of girlish enjoy
ment, and we all teheed with her, at
least In sDirit.
What Is there in roller skating that
makes its victims willing to endure the
agonies of the Beginners' Pen?
One can understand the perseverance of
the boy in the' sweater who slides and
joggles and spraddles .and sprawls his
unruly way from one end of it to the
other, for in strenuoslty is joy for the
bor kind.
But the stouV and studious Individual,
professional by his spectacles and soft
white hand 3. sedentary by his rotundity—
what is there in this latest, maddest fad"
that sets him to struggling with those
fiendish little wheels that snatch his feet
from under him. that bump him. Into wall
and pillar and fence, that set him to wav
ing his -arms like a windmill gone mad.
that plump him flat upon the floor with
an impact that jars his teeth In their
sockets?
What Is there in it that inveigles the
matron out of her dignity into slipping
and; sliding about on <t couple of sets of
costers, clutching at men and women —
without the formality of an Introduction,
remember — whom she would scorn to put
on her visiting list?
Whatever it is. it's a very potent charm,
for from its first dtvotees— the merely
young and giddy and unclassified— lt has
spreaJ until there is no safety in age or
rank. From their first neadquarters,/ at
the large and necessarily democratic Me
chanics' Pavilion, they have overflowed
until there's a rink in every quarter.
Society, of course, cannot be democratic
long, and having fallen victim to the fad,
it soon organized itself into a club that
ei: joyed the privileges of the Pavilion
without the intrusion of the mob one
nisrht every week. It was the Monday
" Night Club, with a membership of 500. and
a list of patronesses that included the
names of the undisputed leaders— Mrs.
Kleanor Martin, for instance: Mr& Dow
ney Harvey, Mrs. Walter Hobart, Mre.
James Follia.. The club was organized
foi but four nights' skating, but so splen
didly did the finances and the enthusiasm
hold cut that its skating extended over
nine nights, and it has disbanded reluc
tantly oaly at the approach of Lent.
So potent is its charm that it has be
guiled not only the most unexpected
victims into skating, but hard-headed
business men into investing . their
money in leases, rink floors and skates.
The pavilion is frankly democratic,
advertising its masked skating carni
vals unbiushlngly with prizes for "a fat
ladles* race," "most comic lady's cos
tume" and "most comic gent's costume."
So. quite naturally. In the face of this
there has sprung up a new and exclu
sive rink on Pacific avenue. In the old
armory, that was once upon a time in
its history a riding school for fashion
also. Here all sweaters and never
show-dirt shirts are to be barred; no
"fat ladles* races" are to be contested:
no "genta" are to be on the list of eli
gibles. It is to be small and highly
select, and already its list of patrons
reads like a chapter from the Blue
Book.
Jewish society has made for itself
quite the most exclusive \u25a0 and hand
somest skatlnfe rink in the city by turn
ing the . spacious, lofty, well lighted,
beautifully floored ballroom of the
Concordia Club from its original pur
pose. There the 'club members practice
of mornings" with skilled instructors,
and there they have a ladies' night once
a week that is as well attended as tha
smartest dance or swcllest wedding.
Quite as naturally rinks sprang up or
are about to. spring up in the Mission,
in the Richmond district, south of
Market and— where do you think this
last one Is? — on' the Barbary Coast!
Yes, even those freebooters of the night
life are abandoning the waltz and the
two-step — -33 they practice it — and are
taking to the little wheels and going
round and round and round with the
rest of the World, fashionable and
otherwise. CfcJK \u25a0
What greater proof can there be of
the lure of the roller skate when in this
territory, already famous for its skates,
the denizens take to the new kind!
Billy, the laundryman. came to the res
"Some green hand in his establishment
made an awful mlxup and bits of the
Van Slcklen wearing apparel were dis
tributed throughout the community wher©
they would do the most good. The dilapi
dated condition of moat of the articles re
joiced the hearts of the recipients. Bord
well drew a dress shirt and a union suit
which he says he would have been
ashamed to send to a rummage sale.
"Every piece was plainly marked "Van
S..' so that there was no doubtabout It.
Several returned their finds directly^to tha
owners, and one aggressive lady . aug-;
gested a Joint note of sympathy and offe"r
of pecuniary assistance.
"It was evidently -most distressing to
the aristocracy, and Bordwell avers: that
the 'For . Rent* sign , now upon the Van
Slcklen bouse \u25a0is the direct result. ";Ha )
says that Billy's talent is certainly mar
velous, and in spite of; the laundryman's
protestations, he Insists that it was a.
beautifully worked out "plan from begin
ning to end. as Billy acknowledges that
the Van Sicklens .were three months be-,
hind on his books.
VBordwell says this la not the v only

	<text>COSTUMES FOR THE ALL-ABSORBING CRAZE
Feminine Tears
Are Unbecoming
V I — V-l ls considered unbecoming by w*nen to
a ' I shed tears when in trouble. They are
SBS B •_« placing themselves on an equality with
WOW O mei^ in all way«, and, hs men are sup
posed, never to be guilty of such weak
ness, women also must imitate this
stoicism and develop hardness or Htrong-minded-
QeM, whichever we may choose to call it. It is
very questionable if this is good for women in
any way; it is a relief to shed tears, and many a
nun would be glad if it were not regarded as
CowardiM for him to weep. It is Nature's meth
od, or one of her methods, of assuaging grief, and
the inability to indulge in tears leads many men
to drink as a means of giving vent to their feel
ings. '; .'._
From another point of view, however, this stoi
cism is certainly prejudicial;. that is, in the
chances of marriage. Whatever men may say, it
is inherent in them to like a tender woman; they
tte in her one who will sympathize with them,
and who will come to them for sympathy.' No
man really likes to see a woman cry, for it hurts
K irn and makes him uncomfortable until he can
do something to relieve ,but all men prefer
a woman who can and does cry. Not a foolish,
faint-hearted specimen of humanity, who flops
down at any trouble, however small, but really a
tender-hearted creature who, although brave'
enough, does not try to encase herself in a kind
of additional outer skin, or suit of mail, that will
render her proof against sentiment. A woman
of that sort, they not unnaturally imagine, will
be a very undesirable helpmeet in thia world of
ups and dowus, and they look for one who has
not lost the ability to weep in true feminine
iushiou. . .■"•'{'"■:
In spite of their moral strength, Mien always
want some one in whom they can eonfld| What
encouragement can they expect fcoin a woman
who knows not how to wet-p, amP regards it as
undignified?
T— ""IHE athletic Winter Girl is bubbling over
with the buoyancy of her spirits.
mjgWfl What's the answer? Guess.
KSECq Another hygienic and beauty-wooing
diversion has been added to her list of
indoor winter sports, — roller skating;
before which throngs of enthusiasts willingly bow.
And mcthiukn that morning tennis and croquet
clubs, which were so fashionable last winter, will
now go a-begging.
This whirling through the air is a most invigo
rating form of exercise, keeping the body in a
good, steady motion (that is, after you have gone
through the preliminary stages of proper balan
cing, when your physical and mental forces some
times woefully desert you).
The exercise brings all the muscles of the body
into play, stretching those the average woman
seldom employs, besides stimulating the blood
into healthy, vitalizing action.
Not one woman in ten takes the proper amount
of exercise; yet she wonders why she easily tire*,
why her complexion is dull and colorless and her
circulation poor and languid. Here's her beauty
balm, packed down and running over.
The benefits of ukating are materially increased
when the fair whirler will make up her mind to
take deep, full breaths, such a* can only be ac
complished when the shoulders are thrown back
and client out, in place of the atingy, little in
halations that utterly ignore the upper portions
of the lungs.
ROLLER SKATING ABROAD.
Heir, then, is au ideal exercise, that will keep
you in good physical trim until the outing season
intervenes. Let me conclude thin overture set
ting forth the manifold benefits of roller skating
by saying that Madame Heavyweight and her
oliiu, aimeinir little sister will i-.ich deiive physi
cal battarOMDt particularly suited to their indi
vidual woe».
We Americans are faddists at best with regard
to our pleasures.
T.OS ANGELES HERALD SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT
We take hold of a new diversion, run it to
death in six months, shelve it and take up an
other. With the present advent of roller skating,
however, it is likely that it will make good for
a considerably longer time.
In foreign capitals, London, Paris, Vienna and
Berlin, roller skating is regarded quite as essen
tial an amusement as theatres and music halls,
and here the rinks are never closed except in
midsummer.
The costuming is usually elaborate, often fanci>
ful, and the scene as a whole, a very picturesque
and interesting spectacle.
.mere is a wide difference between the charac
teristic types of the skaters of the two countries;
the sturdy, blonde-haired (Jerinun fruulein, and
the dninty Parisian, with her perfect coiffure and
chic toilette, are good example* of whut 1 mean.
Fancy dress costumes, bal masques, as Paris
calls them, are frequent occurrences, and many
of these are given, both in private rinks, rented
especially for the occasion, and in the large pub
lic rinks. All manner of fancy skating is intro
duced, and in some cases national dances are
given on roller skates.
In London, while the King, Queen Alexandra
and Princes* Victoria do not actually indulge in
the merry sport, they often occupy a private
box on gali occasions, and saem to thoroughly en
joy the merry spectacle.
Pauline Chase, the original Pink Pajama Uirl,
hat recently introduced a very novel skate dance
in Ixindon that is making a great hit.
But how boon, here in America, are we going
to introduce our foreign cousin*' idea of a carni
val on roller skates? Here's a chance for a wide
awake manager!
<;\KH ACCORDING TO HOUR OK lUY
The Americau girl, as ever, has adopted l>rue
i,,il and becoming attire for this indoor *p«rt
that i.i in perfect taste for the- hour of day or
uight.
For the morning sessions the fair skater is very
simply gowned in a rather severe tailored suit,
with morning skirt of plaited linen or dainty ba
liste, or fine French flannel, both styles being
frequently hand embroidered.
In place of the separate* waist, which is more
practical and comfortable on account of its light
weight, a waist is worn to match the skirt, mak
ing a three-piece suit. The waist may be of the
same material, or of silk trimmed with the cloth,
r more fashionable combination this winter. The
flannel waist referred to is not unpleasantly
heavy, as it is the same quality used for outing
wear in the summer.
White or cream serge skirt worn with lingerie
waist make* v pretty and attractive costume. The
skirt and waist, too, may be kept in the locker
or in care of the wardrobe woman and left there
for a small sum each week.
Roller skating seems to have captivated soci
ety people. Especially in the morning do the
girls make the largest showing, since there is
less to do on the social program, and a string of
automobile* and carriage* is always along the
curb at thia hour of the day.
GAY COSTUMES FOR AFTERNOON AND
EVENING.
Quite a stunning array of gown* is seen in the
afternoon, many of which are typical matinee
toilette*; short skirts, of course. A number of
dressy bodices are worn, white or those in pale
shades, harmonizing with the skirt*. A mlk or
ahiffon blouse will top off a skirt of plain cloth
or figured cloth. Many fetching plaid suits are
worn, and in place of the small turban hats,
larger one* are worn in the afternoon, laden with
flowers, grape* and feather*. The surplice and
fumpar with tfuimpes of lingerie, silk or
shiffon! •'!.■ Mry attractive.
Prime** and piiBMM corselet gowns aie worn
for afternoon and evening, developed in a quan
tity of fashionable materials.
At night the scene presented is brilliant; white,<
pale and brilliant colors are worn, and the gown
ing is often quite elaborate. A favorite style for
evening wear is a silk or velvet Dutch dress
(which is a princess, cut with low neck and
shoulder straps), worn over a frivolous little
guimpe of some sort, chiffon, lace or silk.
A striking model of this description was worn
the other evening; a wine-colored dress, panne
velvet, "with self-colored chiffon guimpe, trimmed
with bands of passementerie and silver buttons
and a large cream felt hat with wine-red plumes
shaded to pink.
Another was of black corduroy, princess corse
let (low) with bretelles of black velvet and baby
Irish crochet waist over pale blue chiffon. The
hat was a "magpie" model, narrow brim of cha
mois-colored felt and crush crown of pale blue vel
vet caught at the side with small black plumes
and rhinestone buckle.
I describe these costumes to show you how
the fittingly well-dressed women choose their rai

have small waist* in the evening. Feminine vani
ty is a stronger force than self-preservation.

shoes with wide, extended soles, otherwise the

By FRANCKS SHAFFER.
As one sees children gliding along on
roller skates, coasting down hill and
gaining greater speed as they go, there
is always the Impression that it Is a
dangerous bit of sport. Then one re
members that little folk are bound to
take their chanees and that at the worst
the only consequences of a tumble or
two may be a few bumps and bruises.
But the figures recently given out by
the National Highways Protective So
ciety startle one Into believing that there
Is ample ground for the Impression, and
that the sport Is Just as dangerous as
it looks.
In the ten months of this year In
Greater -New York VK young lives were
sacrificed to the craze for roller skating.
Sometimes the trouble came at the
handa of automobiles or heavy trucks.
and sometimes the boys and girls, going
faster and faster on their down-nm-
coast, fell and that ended It all. For
they gain great speed as they get under
way, and when an accident comes the
blow is pretty heavy, and the little folk
pay the price of their venturesome plea'
sure.
Worth While to Take Care.
Probably those figures are not ap
proached in any other city in the world.
Europe cannot equal them anywhere,
and surely our smaller cities and towns
do not pay so oeariy tor tne cnuaisn
pastime. But it Is worth wnile for
fathers and mothers everywhere to take
care when their little folk Indulge their
fancy for the sport; and if they do not
bar out the level spots they can stand
guard over the graves
A day or so ago when three little tots
were seen speeding and coasting about
on skates that fairly skipped over the
giound. some passersby were heard to
remark that there would be some broken
heads or shattered bones before many
days went by If that racing kept up
much longer. The only reply was "Non
sense," and as no direful reports have
been heard presumably all has gone well
with the loung racers, but tnose ios
deaths In one great cit. Just from roller
skating, make one realize that "Non
sense" Is not all that should be said
Whatever else those figures may em
phasize, there Is the one great crying
need thrt they bring to light the need
of the children for playgrounds where
they can gather together and play to
their hearts' content. Just as nolslli or
as quietly as they like
Infnlr to Children.
Few, very few of our cities, are fair
to the children. They warn them that
they must not do this and they cannot
do that, they must not play ball for fear
of broken windows and they must not
play with roller skates for fear of
broken heads Rightly enough they are
scolded and threatened when they run

drivers and run the rlek of something
worse They are told the 're a nuisance
with their shouting, they run staid
pedestrians down with their blcicles,
they give them a shock with their skat
ing, and the street Is no place for their
I i.o. do not. In sufficient numbers, pro
vide big open spaces where there Is no-
tody to "call them down,' and do not
make up for half the "don'ts" that are
uttered. I
Even once in a while we are eon-j
fronted with some great demand that)
we are told is a public necesslti vo
must have this for the sake of the city's
fair name we need that to show that I
we are progressive, and there is some
thing else that Is a common comfort,
and of course that cannot go by the
board
The city wants them, the clt needs
them, and money Is appropriated and
space devoted to the Improvements that
will make the city grow
But the children They want more
playgrounds and the need them too.
for the sake of growing big and strong
and wholesome like the blossoms that
have light, air, and room a plent
The bigger and more crowded the citl.
the greater the need for playgrounds,
but It Is only In the great open country
that there Is no pla -problem at all It
was In a little village this summer that
a party of city folk saw scores of chil
dren playing about In the streets. That.
of Itself, was nothing, for they alwais
will play there But the strangers look
ed about them for the traditional "vil
lage green ' looked for front lards, back
yards, too. and they did not wonder that
the boys and girls flocked out to the
sfreets there was nowhere else to go
The rich folk, the well-to-do folk, the
comfortable even where, do not alwais
think very much about pla) grounds.
Their boys and girls can play In the
open, and can keep off the busy streets,
but of those 10b children killed while
roller skating, most of them skated and
played In the thick of traffic because they
had no play space of their own and no
big place where they could go.
Children do not have to skate, do not
have to romp and shout or play on the
city streets, but nature made them want
and need to, and cities should give them
the space.</text>

HAS THE FEVER
Roller Skating Craze Expert
encing Its Greatest Revi
val this Winter,
FIVE RINKS ARE BUILT
EVERY EVIDENCE THAT THE
CRAZE HAS GREATER STABILI
TY NOW THAN ORIGINALLY
THE POLO PROSPECTS.
Richmond, according to M. C. Hen-
ly, is not the only city In the United
States where the roller skating craze
has again returned to favor. Mr.
Henley said last night that the de'
mand for skates had been greater this
year than at' any time since the
eighties, when people skated on side
walks, in barns, and almos went so
far as to try it In their own homes. At
the Ilenler skate factory on North
16th street,' a largo force of men Is
now engaged turning out the rollers
and the demand Is greatest for ball
bearing skates. The cheap ones do
not go anymore.
Fine Rinks are Built.
Roller skating now has its greatest
popularity In Pennsylvania, while
other parts of the East are also tak-
ing It up. California and Texas are
getting the fever in a most noticeable
manner. Mr. Henley says that not
withstanding that the skating craze fs
not as general as it w-s twenty-Are
years ago, it has the signs of greater
stability.- Splendid rinks are being
built tin most cities that now hare th
fever, thua Indicating that the mai
agers are satisfied that the form ct
recreation is likely to stay for son
time. . . I
Mr. Henley started In' the skatf
business In 1880 and he has seen thi
"skating disease" in prosperity anl

hard times. It is an amusement i"
which will always be popular wit f
the middle class of people," said Mrj f
Henley last night. "The country has
had a rest from indoor skating for sev 1 I
era! years and it would not surprise l
me to sea them take it up again with
even as mucn iervor as twenty-nve
years ago."
The Polo Prospects.
About polo, Mr. Henley still retains
the same opinion which he expressed
some time ago. He does not think
that it-should be tried until the lov
ers of i the game can be given just as
good sport as they saw when the
Western League was at its height, and
he does not think that it would be pol
icy to form another league ia this
state until the' people get real good
and anxious for the game. He says
that he has received two invitations
this winter to attend meetings- at
Anderson to help revive the sport,
but he turned down both offers.</text>

	<text>HARDING AS YOUTH
DENIED PAY RAISE
Services as Roller Rink
Trombone Player Not Worth
Increase, Owner Held.
By the Associated Press,
NEW YORK, December 13.—Robert
H. Davis tells in a copyrignted story in
the Sun today of a skating rink pro
prietor who discharged a trombone
player and so turned the aspiring musi
cian into other paths of endeavor, paths
that led in time to the presidency of
the United States.
When the roller skating craze swept
over the country in the early 80’s of the
last century, a young Italian named Pete
Venuti opened a rink in Marion, Ohio,
and installed an eight-piece orchestra.
The least of the players in that band
was one who played the slide trombone
and in due time blew' his courage up to
the point of demanding an increase of
salary. He was getting 50 cents a night
and felt quite sure that he was worth 75.

“Why should I pay him 75 cent*?’’
Venuti asked his orchestra leader. “He
isn’t worth 50. Fire him. Do it now.”
The artist was fired. The roller
skating craze passed in due time to the
limbo of other fads. Venuti turned to
other tasks, joined the gold rush and
married a girl in the Klondyke. As the
years passed they raised a family of
three sons.
When America entered the World
War the youngest eon joined. With the
end of the war. Pvt. Venuti was listed as
missing and unaccounted for.
From their fellow townsman, Warren
Gamaliel Harding, President of the
United States, Pete Venuti and his two
remaining sons received invitations to
attend the solemn ceremonies incident
to interment of the Unknown Soldier at
Washington as guests of the White
House.
The day after the ceremonies the
President and the former skating rink
proprietor sat smoking In the White
House and talking of days gone by.
The Executive recalled the discharge
of the young trombone player from
Venuti’s rink.
“Pete,” said the President, "why
didn't you see that 25-cent raise?”
“Because,” Venuti answered after a
thoughtful pull at his cigar, “I didn’t
think you were worth the raise then.
Warren, and I still don’t think so.”
Before they parted for the night
Venuti asked why President Harding
had invited him and his sons to the
burial of the Unknown Soldier.
“Well, Pete,” said the President, with
a hand on the other’s shoulder,

	<text>HISTOIIY OP UObbKIl SKATING.
The Present la iho Third Crnzo of
the Kind lit This Country Costly
New York Sun.
Roller skating is by no moans a modem
om amusement. A patent for n rollc
akato was Istucd In Franco in 1819
From that tlmo to the year 18G3 thur
were nine patents leaned for roller skates
Three of thote were French , three Eng.
liih , and three Amorlc < m. In all of them
the wheels were set iu fixed sockets , and
run only in a direction parallel with thi
length of the skate , There was some
variation in the stzo of the wheels , and
their number varied from two to five ,
There was an attempt to adapt them tc
the capabilities of ice skates by varying
the position and slzo of the wheels , but
it was not until 18G3 that any success
WM secured In making roller skatoa with
which the skater could make all the
muttons that can bo performed on ice
skates. In the year 18G3 James L
Plimpton of New York patented the
guldablo roller akato. This waa a radlcaf
improvement in attaching the runncra o :
rollers to the stock or foot stand of thi
skate , whereby thn rollers or runners are
made to turn or cant by the rocking of
the stock or foot stand so as to factliato
the turning of the skate on the ice o
floor and admit of the skater's performing
with ease gyrations or revolutions with
out tcatlni ; unduly the muscles of the
foot or ankles. Mr. Plimpton made 1m
provomonta on his own Invention , whlcl
were patented in 18G5 and 18GG , and
eiuco that time there has bcon no leas
than 345 patents for various modification
of roller skates chiefly in England and
America. But the practical loller skate
of to-day Is substantially an American
invention. There are thousands of par
sons engaged In their manufacture , and
they have boon introduced all over the
ijlobe' .
The present roller-skating craze is by
no means the first. It Is , in fact , the
third. There was a very extensive roller-
skating craze in this country in 1872 when
there were many skating rinks and many
thousand skaters in various patts of the
country , nnd in some places almost as
nuch excitement over it as there Is now.
[ lollor skating halls wcro established in
.hia city by Mr. Plimpton as long ago as
L8G5. They were attended by staid and
orderly people , including ministers , dea
cons and church member ? , and on one
> ccaslon the good folks astonished their
'riends , and , In fact , themselves by a
waltz figure during lent. They did not
iwako to the enormity of the offaiso nu
ll some of the newspaper began to write
horn up. Roller skating was extensively
ntroducod in schools and continued iu
> rlvato social circles for many years with-
iut any attempt to make the skating halls
ho resort of promisculoui assemblages.
In 18GG roller skatirg was started at
Newport in the Atlantic boas ? , and for
several years was patronized by tha best
society. The largo dining room of the
Atlantic was used for skating , and clergy
men , lawyers , doctors , and the most ex
emplary citizens jolnod in the apart.
Ia 1870 a considerable number of lead-
ng members of New York society were
nterested Jn roller skating. The Union
club members were prominent in it.
Among those who participatedwcra James
J. Bennett , M. Douglas , A. Wiight'San-
ord , Mr. Howland , Mrs. John Jay ,
Ur Livingston , and others equally welt
known. They first engaged Lyrlo hall ,
and subsequently Irving hall , and the
attendance was very select. The public
was not admitted.
_ The first absolute public roller-skating
ink in this countr ywas established in
Ilncinnati in 1807 , and the amusement
ook a firm hold there. They had a news-
> apor devoted to the interest ] of rollor-
kating , published in 1877 , called the
Skate Roll. At that time the rinks were
igldly conducted , ao as to Interest the
lost conservative and orderly ( persons ,
'bo rules and regulations of the floor also
were such as would obviate many of the
bjectinns to the modern skating rink.
Mr. Plimpton had bis skates patented
n England and about ten years ago there
was a roller-skating craze in that country
Imilar to that which prevails here now ,
with the exception that it waa atartfad
-Ith the deliberate purpose of interesting
tie most conservative and orderly people ,
nd to make It a reputable amusement ,
'hero wcro at one time about 400 placca
or roller skating in England. Mr.
'limpton invested considerable ) capital in
10 entorpriao and as soon aa ho became
uccetaful found himself confronted with
n army of infrirgora. Ho fought about
wo dozen of these infringes in the law
ourts and won all hla suits. Roller skat- .
ig in England waa conducted at first tin-
er very high social auspices. There waa
no club known aa the Prince Club , which
onaiated entirely of titled personages
3d their children. The suits to restrain
10 infringers of the American patents at- ;
ractod widespread attention , nnd the
lals were attended by great crowds ,
'ho American pitentco won denounced as
monopolist. His law expontoa were
normons , Fabulous storiea were told of
Is profits , and ho undoubtedly made a
rcat deal of money from hia invention ,
[ o foresaw the objec'ions that might bo
alsed , and anticipated the strongest argu-
nonts now brought to boar against the
fating rlnki. The rinks thit he ostab-
shed were regulated by atrlngent con-
acts , so as to forestall and prevent
icso objections. This ho did from the
onviction that as a matter of enlightened
elf-interest , it wouldbo most profitable
o make roller skating respectable.
Mr , Plimpton has had considerable
tigation in this country to protect hla
nvcntlon. Hla patents expired in Juno ,
883. Ho has not , however , lost his in-
orest In roller skating , but deprecates
iio surroundings that have now been con-

	<text>Roller Skating on the Main
Thoroughfares Assuming
Serious Proportions
Who will he the first to build a
rolling' skating rink somewhere in the
downtown district?
This is the question that is agitat
ing the police department, for it is
feared that unless a rink is construct
ed in the near future someone will
get killed or seriously injured as the
result of the roller skating craze which
has struck Birmingham with the sud
denness of a tornado.
On every street in Birmingham where
the asphalt pavement permits boys
and girls and the grown-ups also are
skating madly—daringly throughout
the day and throughout the night.
The roller skating craze has reached
suoh proportions that the sporting
goods dealers have been caught nap
ping and are not able to supply the
demand for skates. It appears that
everybody wants to skate. On these
moonlight nights "skating parties" are
being given and automobllists have to
display much dexterity at the wheel
to avoid knocking over groups of
skaters on nearly every part of High
land avenue. However, the skaters do
not appear to care about passing au
tomobiles as in the zest of tl)e new
sport all sense of personal danger is
forgotten in the main idea of being
able to keep up with the bunch.
The police and city commission be
lieve that if a first class skating rink
was constructed many of the skaters
who have been enjoying Highland ave
nue and other well paved streets would
take to the enclosed rinks. Of course
there are laws at the Present time to
keep the joyful skaters off the Public
streets, but the police are always em
barrassed about enforcing this ordi
nance—especially when they happen to
?un against a bevy of youthful beauties
who allow there isn’t any harm in
^Anyway, everyone is hoping that no
accidents will happen, for the roller
skating craze is a healthy one77f'"d *
happy one if you’re able to keep on
your feet. It is quite embarassing if you
don’t. But then the streets are well
paved—and can resist most any shock.
